        HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for 
        documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by 
        technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages 
        such as JavaScript.<br>
        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage 
        and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the 
        structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the 
        appearance of the document.<br>
        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, 
        images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the 
        rendered page.<br>
